## The Challenge

Financial data comes from many sources, each with their own identifiers.  
The core challenge is: *"Is this the same company across different sources?"*

---

## Core Principles

Entity ≠ Security ≠ Listing is fundamental to EntitySpine.
    A company (entity) can have multiple securities (stocks, bonds),
    and each security can be listed on multiple exchanges. Tickers
    change, companies reorganize, and securities get relisted.
    
    By treating these as separate concepts linked by relationships,
    we can track changes over time and avoid the common mistake of
    equating "AAPL" with "Apple Inc." permanently.

## General

One command generates all documentation. The orchestrator
    knows how to build the graph, run all renderers, and write
    output files. No manual steps required.

The power of a knowledge graph is in querying it. This class
    provides a clean interface to retrieve documentation fragments
    by various criteria - doc-type, tags, section, priority, etc.
    No need to learn a query language; just call methods.

*Source: [`DocumentationQuery`](/app/projects/spine-core/src/doc-automation/src/doc_automation/graph/queries.py#L25)*

Code is the source of truth. Documentation should be extracted
    FROM code, not written separately and hope it stays in sync.
    The AST Walker is the foundation - it reads code structure
    so we can mine documentation from docstrings.

*Source: [`ASTWalker`](/app/projects/spine-core/src/doc-automation/src/doc_automation/parser/ast_walker.py#L90)*

Documentation belongs WITH code. Extended docstrings let us
    embed rich, structured documentation directly in Python classes.
    This parser extracts that structure and makes it queryable.

*Source: [`DocstringParser`](/app/projects/spine-core/src/doc-automation/src/doc_automation/parser/docstring_parser.py#L71)*

Renderers transform knowledge graph queries into documents.
    Each renderer knows how to assemble one type of document
    from fragments. Templates handle formatting; renderers handle
    the query logic and data assembly.

*Source: [`BaseRenderer`](/app/projects/spine-core/src/doc-automation/src/doc_automation/renderers/base.py#L18)*

The MANIFESTO is the "why" document. It explains the core
    principles that guide the project. By extracting these from
    code docstrings, we ensure the manifesto stays in sync with
    actual code philosophy.

Data comes from many sources in many formats. The FeedAdapter
    provides a consistent interface for ingesting data, normalizing
    it, and loading it into EntitySpine storage.
