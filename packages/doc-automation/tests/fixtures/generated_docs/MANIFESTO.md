## Core Principles

Entity ≠ Security ≠ Listing is fundamental to EntitySpine.
    A company (entity) can have multiple securities (stocks, bonds),
    and each security can be listed on multiple exchanges. Tickers
    change, companies reorganize, and securities get relisted.
    
    By treating these as separate concepts linked by relationships,
    we can track changes over time and avoid the common mistake of
    equating "AAPL" with "Apple Inc." permanently.

## General

Data comes from many sources in many formats. The FeedAdapter
    provides a consistent interface for ingesting data, normalizing
    it, and loading it into EntitySpine storage.
