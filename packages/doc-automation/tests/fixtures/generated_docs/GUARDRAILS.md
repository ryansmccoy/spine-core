## EntityResolver

### ❌ Do NOT use ticker as primary key (tickers change!)

✅ **Instead:** Use CIK as primary, map tickers via claims

*From [`EntityResolver`](tests\fixtures\sample_annotated_class.py#L9)*

### ❌ Do NOT assume 1:1 ticker-to-entity mapping

✅ **Instead:** Handle multiple entities sharing same ticker historically

*From [`EntityResolver`](tests\fixtures\sample_annotated_class.py#L9)*

### ❌ Do NOT mix entity and security identifiers

✅ **Instead:** Use separate resolution paths

*From [`EntityResolver`](tests\fixtures\sample_annotated_class.py#L9)*

## FeedAdapter

### ❌ Do NOT skip validation for "trusted" sources

✅ **Instead:** Always validate, trust but verify

*From [`FeedAdapter`](tests\fixtures\sample_annotated_class.py#L187)*

### ❌ Do NOT lose source metadata during transformation

✅ **Instead:** Preserve lineage in metadata columns

*From [`FeedAdapter`](tests\fixtures\sample_annotated_class.py#L187)*
